# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
A lending company wanted to keep up with the technolagy and leverage machine learning in their process for credit risk prediction. We used multiple machine learning models to help make the appropriate prediction for the company. The different models were as follow: 

    * Oversampling: RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
    * Undersampling: ClusterCentroids algorithm
    * Combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling: SMOTEENN algorithm
    * Predict credit risk: BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier
## Results:
